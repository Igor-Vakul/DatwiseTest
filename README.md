# SafetyPortal — Workplace Safety Management System
> Datwise Technical Assignment | Candidate submission

## 3.1 Business Need

A **Safety Officer (מנהל בטיחות)** at an industrial facility faces several daily challenges:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Incidents reported on paper or in spreadsheets | Data is lost, unsearchable, no audit trail |
| No centralized tracking of corrective actions | Actions fall through the cracks, overdue items unnoticed |
| No real-time KPIs for management | Safety officer cannot demonstrate trends or prioritize work |
| Role-based access not enforced | Employees access data they should not see |

**SafetyPortal** digitizes this workflow end-to-end: incident submission → assignment → corrective actions → closure — with a live dashboard showing KPIs and trend charts.

---

## 3.2 Solution Chosen

**Incident Reporting & Corrective Action Management Portal**

**Advanced extensions implemented:**
1. 🔐 **Information Security** — JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization (Admin / SafetyManager / Supervisor / Employee), API endpoints protected by policy
2. 📊 **Report Visualization & Dashboard** — KPI cards, doughnut/bar/line charts (Chart.js), recent incidents table; donut chart supports Category / Severity / Status grouping with count + percentage in legend
3. ⏱️ **Background Jobs (Hangfire)** — Fire-and-forget email notifications, daily recurring reminders, delayed escalation scheduling
4. 📎 **File Attachments** — Upload/download/delete incident attachments with magic-byte validation and size limits
5. 📥 **Excel Export** — Filtered export of incidents and corrective actions using EPPlus
6. 🏢 **Admin: Departments & Categories** — Full CRUD with Bootstrap modals, department color picker (colors reflected in dashboard bar chart), IsActive toggle, delete restriction on open incidents
7. 📦 **Incident Archive** — Soft-delete via `IsArchived` flag; only Closed incidents can be archived; archived incidents excluded from dashboard stats; Active/Archived tabs on list page

---

## 3.3 Technology Choices

### Why .NET 10?

.NET 10 was chosen as the most recent and optimized version of the Microsoft runtime available at the time of development. It delivers peak runtime performance, improved memory management, and faster startup times compared to previous releases. Building on .NET 10 ensures the system runs on a modern, actively maintained, and secure foundation with long-term support.

### Why Minimal API?

Minimal API was deliberately chosen over classic MVC/Web API as a forward-looking architectural decision. Its lightweight, function-oriented structure makes it straightforward to extract individual endpoint groups into independent microservices in the future — each `Map*Endpoints` class can become its own deployable service with minimal structural change. In addition, Minimal API has lower overhead, faster cold-start times, and reduced memory footprint compared to the full MVC pipeline — key advantages in a microservices environment.

### API Endpoints

| Group | Endpoints |
|-------|-----------|
| Auth | `POST /api/auth/login`, `GET /api/auth/me` |
| Incidents | `GET/POST /api/incidents`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/incidents/{id}`, `PUT /{id}/archive` |
| Corrective Actions | `GET/POST /api/corrective-actions`, `PUT /{id}/status`, `DELETE /{id}` |
| Dashboard | `GET /api/dashboard/stats` |
| Lookup | `GET /api/lookup/departments`, `/categories` (active only), `/users`, `/roles` |
| Users (Admin) | `GET/POST /api/users`, `PUT /api/users/{id}/toggle-active` |
| Admin Departments | `GET/POST /api/admin/departments`, `PUT /{id}`, `PUT /{id}/toggle-active`, `DELETE /{id}` |
| Admin Categories | `GET/POST /api/admin/categories`, `PUT /{id}`, `PUT /{id}/toggle-active`, `DELETE /{id}` |
| Attachments | `POST/GET /api/incidents/{id}/attachments`, `GET /{attId}/download`, `DELETE /{attId}` |
| Export | `GET /api/incidents/export`, `GET /api/corrective-actions/export` |
| Hangfire | `GET /hangfire` (Admin dashboard), `GET/POST /jobs/login`, `GET /jobs/logout` |

### Security Architecture

- **JWT tokens** signed with HS256, 120-minute expiry
- **Authorization policies**: `AdminOnly`, `SafetyManagerOrAdmin`, `Authenticated`
- **Server-side session** stores JWT in Web Forms (not exposed to browser)
- **Role-based UI**: Admin menu visible only to Admins; delete/manage buttons gated by role

#### Rate Limiting

| Policy | Limit | Scope |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `login` | 10 requests / minute / IP | `POST /api/auth/login` only |
| `api` | 300 requests / minute / IP | All other API endpoints |

Requests exceeding the limit receive `429 Too Many Requests`.

#### Account Lockout

After **5 consecutive failed** login attempts the account is locked for **15 minutes**.
The lockout state (`FailedLoginAttempts`, `LockedUntil`) is stored in the `Users` table.
A successful login resets the counter.
Locked accounts receive `423 Locked` with a message indicating remaining time.

#### Security HTTP Headers

Applied to every API response and every Web Forms page:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'` (API) |
| `X-Powered-By` | removed |

#### Open Redirect Prevention

`Login.aspx` validates the `returnUrl` parameter: only paths starting with `/` that do **not** begin with `//` or `/\` are accepted. All other values redirect to `~/Dashboard.aspx`.

#### Password Policy

Enforced at both the Web Forms layer (`BasePage.ValidatePassword`) and the API layer (`[RegularExpression]` DataAnnotation on DTOs):

- Minimum **8 characters**
- At least one **uppercase** letter
- At least one **lowercase** letter
- At least one **digit**
- At least one **special character** (`!@#$%^&*` etc.)

#### Audit Log

All authentication events are persisted to the `AuditLogs` table with timestamp, event type, user email, user ID, and source IP:

| EventType | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| `LoginFailed` | Wrong password or unknown email |
| `AccountLocked` | Account locked after 5 failed attempts |
| `LoginBlocked` | Login attempt while account is already locked |
| `LoginSuccess` | Successful authentication |

#### XSS / HTML Injection Protection

Protection is applied at two independent layers so that neither layer alone is a single point of failure.

| Layer | Where | What it does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Input sanitization** | Web Forms code-behind, on every form submit | `StripHtml()` (compiled regex `<[^>]*>`) removes all HTML tags from every free-text field before the value is sent to the API |
| **Output encoding** | Every `.aspx` template that renders a string | `System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode()` wraps every `<%= ... %>` expression that outputs user-controlled or database-sourced text |
| **JSON injection guard** | `Dashboard.aspx.cs` | `SafeJson()` replaces `</` → `<\/` in JSON strings inlined into `<script>` blocks, preventing `</script>` breakout |
| **API input validation** | All Minimal API DTOs | `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, `[EmailAddress]`, `[Range]` DataAnnotations + `builder.Services.AddValidation()` enforce length limits and reject malformed input at the API boundary |

**Fields sanitized on input (`StripHtml`):**

| Page | Fields |
|------|--------|
| `Login.aspx` | Email |
| `Incidents/Create.aspx` | Title, Description, Location Details |
| `Incidents/Edit.aspx` | Title, Description, Location Details |
| `Incidents/Details.aspx` | Corrective Action Title, Corrective Action Description |
| `Admin/Users.aspx` | Full Name (create & edit), Email, Email Subject, Email Body |

### Web Forms Pages

| Page | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `Login.aspx` | Public | Login with email/password |
| `Dashboard.aspx` | All roles | KPI cards + 3 charts (donut by Category/Severity/Status, bar by department with colors, trend line) + recent incidents |
| `Incidents/List.aspx` | All roles | Paginated list with search/filter, Active/Archived tabs |
| `Incidents/Create.aspx` | All roles | Submit new incident report |
| `Incidents/Details.aspx` | All roles | View details, corrective actions, upload/download/delete attachments |
| `Incidents/Edit.aspx` | All roles | Edit existing incident |
| `CorrectiveActions/List.aspx` | All roles | All actions with overdue highlight |
| `Admin/Users.aspx` | Admin only | Create/toggle-active users |
| `Admin/Departments.aspx` | Admin only | CRUD departments with color picker and IsActive toggle |
| `Admin/Categories.aspx` | Admin only | CRUD incident categories with IsActive toggle |

---

### Background Jobs (Hangfire)

Hangfire is wired into `SafetyPortal.Api` and uses the same SQL Server database for job storage.

| Scenario | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Incident created | Fire-and-forget | Email notification sent to the assigned user immediately |
| Incident updated | Fire-and-forget | Email notification sent to the assigned user immediately |
| Corrective action due | Recurring (daily 08:00) | Reminder email sent 3 days before the due date |
| Incident escalation | Delayed (3 days) | If incident is still Open after 3 days, all Admins/SafetyManagers are notified |

#### Hangfire Dashboard Access

The Hangfire dashboard is available at `/hangfire` and is protected — **Admin role only**.

1. Navigate to `https://localhost:7182/jobs/login`
2. Log in with an Admin account (e.g. `admin@datwise.local` / `Admin123!`)
3. You will be redirected to `https://localhost:7182/hangfire`

The dashboard shows queued, processing, succeeded and failed jobs in real time.

> **Note:** The login at `/jobs/login` uses a separate cookie (`HangfireAuth`) that is independent from the main Web Forms session. This is required because the Hangfire dashboard is served by the API project, not the Web project.

#### Email Configuration (SendGrid)

Email sending requires a SendGrid API key. Configure it in `SafetyPortal.Api/appsettings.json`:

```json
"SendGrid": {
  "ApiKey": "YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY",
  "FromEmail": "noreply@yourdomain.com",
  "FromName": "SafetyPortal"
}
```

If the API key is not set, job execution will fail silently (jobs are still queued and visible in the dashboard).

## 3.4 Running Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [.NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
- SQL Server Express (LocalDB also works)
- Visual Studio 2022 (recommended) **or** VS Code

### Step 1 — Configure Database

Edit `SafetyPortal.Api/appsettings.json`:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=.\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=SafetyPortalDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

### Step 2 — Run the API

```bash
cd SafetyPortal.Api
dotnet run
```

The API will:
- Auto-apply EF Core migrations
- Seed the database (roles, departments, categories, 2 users)
- Start at `https://localhost:7182`
- Swagger UI: `https://localhost:7182/swagger`

### Step 3 — Restore NuGet packages for Web

```bash
cd SafetyPortal.Web
nuget restore
```
Or open `Datwise.sln` in Visual Studio → it will restore automatically.

### Step 4 — Run the Web App

Open `Datwise.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 → Set `SafetyPortal.Web` as startup project → Press **F5**.

The app will open at `https://localhost:44300`.

### Step 5 — Login

| Account | Email | Password | Role |
|---------|-------|----------|------|
| System Admin | `admin@datwise.local` | `Admin123!` | Admin |
| Safety Manager | `safety.manager@datwise.local` | `Safety123!` | SafetyManager |

### Optional: Load Sample Data via SQL

```sql
-- Run database/schema.sql against an empty SafetyPortalDb
-- (only needed if you prefer SQL script over EF migrations)
```
